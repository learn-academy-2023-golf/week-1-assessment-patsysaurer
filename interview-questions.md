# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is the software for version control stored locally and Github is the online platform for cloud version control stored remotely. 

Researched answer: git is a free open-source version control used widely in the programming world the purpose is to track source code changes. Github is an online platform that uses the git technology and allows developers to share code and collaborate on projects. 


2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An array's index is based on the numerical order of it's position. The value is what the index is assigned to. If there is nothing then the value will be undefined. 

Researched answer: Indexes are sequential numbers that are zero indexed based starting at 0 and counting up. Each index is an element and the value is the content of that element. 

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays and Strings are similar by sharing some of the same methods, such as length, concat, indexOf, etc. Some differences are arrays are defined by [] and strings are defined by " ". Arrays are a collection of data and strings are a collection of characters. 

Researched answer: They both are a collection of items and they both share some of the same properties. It is common to convert a string to an array and vice versa using common methods like .join("") and .split("").

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?
   Not sure, I haven't heard of this yet.

Researched answer: 

The four pillars of object oriented programming are 
• Encapsulation -combines data and code into a single unit to prevent unwanted changes
• Data Abstraction - data can change, but not the type
• Polymorphism - allows different classes to use the same behaivor
• Inheritance - allows developers to create subclasses to inherit the parent rules

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher Order Functions: are built-in methods that take a function as an argument and are designed for arrays. Very useful for iteration. 

2. Jest: is a JavaScript testing framework to ensure that the JavaScript codebase is correct. The framework is made up of a dependencies (collection of files) that contain snippets of code functionality.

3. Objects: a JavaScript data type that has a collection of key value pairs. The data inside the object can be static or perform actions with methods.
